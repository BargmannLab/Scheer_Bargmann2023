# Scheer_Bargmann2023 README

This repository contains data files pertaining to Scheer, E. and Bargmann, C. I. (2023). 

Questions about this repository can be directed towards Elias Scheer at elias.scheer@gmail.com or Cori Bargmann at cori@rockefeller.edu 

These data were collected in the Bargmann Lab at Rockefeller University in New York City from 2018-2022.

Funding was provided by HHMI and Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative. Scheer was supported by an NIH F31 Predoctoral fellowship.

This repository contains two code bases:

1) LawnLeavingTracker: a MATLAB-based set of scripts that can find and track single *C.elegans* animals on small lawns of *E.coli* seeded on agar plates. See the README within the LawnLeavingTracker folder for more information.

2) LawnLeavingAnalysis: a Python and Jupyter-notebooks-based set of analyses that reads in the output of LawnLeavingTracker and does further modifications / re-derives certain features and applies the Hidden Markov models used to segment behavioral states. The Jupyter notebooks can generate all figures generated in the paper. See the README within the LawnLeavingAnalysis folder for more information.
